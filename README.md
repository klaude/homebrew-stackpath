# A Homebrew Tap for StackPath Utilities

Install and manage StackPath libraries and utilities through the 
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and [Linuxbrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Linuxbrew) 
package managers for macOS, Linux, and the Windows 10 Subsystem for Linux (WSL). 

## Requirements

Please follow Homebrew's [installation guidelines](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) 
to install Homebrew in macOS or Linuxbrew's 
[installation guidelines](https://docs.brew.sh/Linuxbrew#install) to install 
Linuxbrew in Linux and WSL. 

## Installation

Run `brew tap stackpath/stackpath` to install the StackPath tap. 

## Usage

After installing the StackPath tap use the `brew install`, `brew upgrade`, and 
`brew uninstall` commands to manage your StackPath utilities. For instance, run 
`brew install sp-serverless` to install the [serverless scripting CLI utility](https://github.com/stackpath/serverless-scripting-cli). 

Run `brew search stackpath/stackpath` to see which formulae are available 
through the StackPath tap.
